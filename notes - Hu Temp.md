The error message you're encountering, Fail: 1451 (23000): Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails, indicates that your attempt to delete or update a row in the parent table (students) is being blocked because there are dependent rows in the child table (studentusemachinesinproject) that reference the row you're trying to delete. This behavior is due to a foreign key constraint that enforces referential integrity between the two tables.

Understanding ON DELETE NO ACTION
The default behavior for foreign key constraints in many SQL databases, including MySQL, is ON DELETE NO ACTION. This means that if you try to delete a row in a parent table that has dependent rows in a child table (rows that reference the row you're trying to delete), the delete operation will be blocked, and you'll receive an error message.

ON DELETE NO ACTION is essentially a way to prevent orphaned records in the child tableâ€”rows that refer to a non-existent entry in the parent table. By blocking the delete operation, the database ensures that all references remain valid, thus maintaining the integrity of the relational data.

Why You Encounter an Error
When you encounter this error, it means the database is enforcing referential integrity as expected. The database is preventing you from deleting a row that other rows depend on, thereby avoiding data inconsistencies.




***
When you use cursor.fetchall() in a database programming context (such as Python with libraries like sqlite3, PyMySQL, psycopg2 for PostgreSQL, etc.), the method retrieves all rows of a query result and returns them as a list of tuples. Each tuple corresponds to a row in the result set.

Regarding the types of values it can output:

String: Yes, if the data in a column of a row is a string, the corresponding element in the tuple will be a string. For example, if a column contains text data, fetchall() will return that data in the tuple as a string.

NULL type: Yes, fetchall() can also output NULL values from the database, but how they are represented in the result depends on the programming language and the database adapter you're using. In many programming languages and their database libraries, a SQL NULL is translated to the language's equivalent of a null or none value. For instance, in Python, a SQL NULL will be returned as None in the tuple.

Example:
Consider a database table Users with some rows having NULL in the email column.

ID | Name      | Email
---|-----------|----------------
1  | Alice     | alice@example.com
2  | Bob       | NULL

cursor.execute("SELECT ID, Name, Email FROM Users")
rows = cursor.fetchall()
for row in rows:
    print(row)

Output:
(1, 'Alice', 'alice@example.com')
(2, 'Bob', None)

In this example, you can see that for the Email column of Bob, which is NULL in the database, fetchall() returns None in the tuple for Python. The exact representation of NULL values will be consistent with the conventions of the programming language you are using.
